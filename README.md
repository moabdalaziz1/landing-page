# Landing Page Project
1. i built the navbar using (for loop) and created dynamic (li) items based on the number of sections in the page.
2. then i added the (active) class to the section when near top of viewport and used (scroll) event.
3. then i used scrollTo event to scroll smoothly to the specific section when the user click on the related
navbar item.
4. I added the highlight to the navigation items.
